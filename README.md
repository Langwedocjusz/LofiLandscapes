## Installation

### Cloning
This repository contains submodules and should be cloned recursively:

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/Langwedocjusz/LofiLandscapes <TargetDir>
  
### Building and running
Regardless of the platform make sure cmake is installed and added to your path.

#### On Linux:
For building you can use the provided script `BuildProjects.sh`. It will ask you to choose either 'Debug' or 'Release' configuration.
Afterwards you can run the program from the top level of the repository:

	./build/bin/LofiLandscapes
  
#### On Windows:
The provided batchfile `WIN_GenerateProjects.bat` will generate a Visual Studio solution.
After running it you can open `build/LofiLandscapes.sln` to select configuration, build and run the program.

## Features

### Generation
Terrain is procedurally generated by stacking together different operations, akin to how modifiers work in blender:
<img src="/img/Terrain.gif" width="885" height="509"/>

Materials and their distribution are controlled in exactly the same way:
<p float="left">
  <img src="/img/Material.gif" width="443" height="255"/>
  <img src="/img/MaterialMap.gif" width="443" height="255"/> 
</p>

Since the generated terrain and its materials are fully determined only by the parameters of the operations used, they can be trivially serialized and de-serialized. Examples of landscapes, serialized as human-readable json files can be found in the `examples` directory.
